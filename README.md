<h1>About the project</h1>

It has been done to practice so consider a few things
<ul>
  <li>Expect many bugs in the code</li>
  <li>It includes a login and register system, however, it's not connected to any API, it was just to test React Hook Router and Yup</li>
  <li>You are free to colaborate with this project or use it as you wish</li>
</ul>
